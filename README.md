# Project-8-SQL-Library
Working with databases — storing, retrieving, updating and deleting information — is an important software developer skill.
In this project, I have created a web application for listing, adding, updating, 
and deleting books in a library application, using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

Download and extarct the zip file and run npm install. Naviagte to the package.json file and in scripts replace the start with "start": "nodemon app.js".
Then run npm start and the project will run on localhost 3000.
